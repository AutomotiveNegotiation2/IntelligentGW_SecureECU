/**
 *  \file tidl_dataflow.h
 *
 *  \brief This file contains interface to use TIDL's DMA dataflow to pipeline
 *         optimized kernel processing with DMA.
 *
 *   Usage Scenario 1 :
 *   User wants to write a best optimized version where they have some processing
 *   task which is not required to be repeated with every time kernel is called
 *   with new input within a layer's processing. To allow user to have this one
 *   time kind of processing an initialization function option is provided.
 *   User can implement such processing and then provide the function pointer to
 *   TIDL_DataflowInit function as part of TIDL_DataflowInitParams->initFuncPtr.
 *   User is expected to adhere to the signature of initFuncPtr and the same can
 *   be found in TIDL_DataflowKernelInitFuncPtr definition
 *   When user provides initFuncPtr, TIDL will internally call this function to
 *   create multiple kernel handles based on which region of the tensor processing
 *   is happening ( e.g. whether its last block of processing where dimension of
 *   processing block can be different). The information of the dimension is provided
 *   by srcAddr and dstAddr arguments to the init function and user is expected to use
 *   these dimension for the implementation of this function.
 *   Typically things which are needed only once per tensor/frame can be computed inside
 *   this function and stored in the handle. This will avoid their computation during execute
 *   call. Eg. of such information can be SE/SA templates creation which are used during kernel
 *   implementation, or some one time buffer used by the kernel.
 *   This is the preferred usage as it will be optimal without user needing to handle
 *   various regions of processing.
 *
 *   Below code shows a sample usage of these API's for this scenario
 *
 *   TIDL_DataflowInitParams initParams;
 *   TIDL_CustomMaxPoolIxXOxXInitArgs kernelInitArgs;
 *
 *   initParams.dataFlowType     = TIDL_DataFlowTypeOneTensorInProcOneChannel;
 *   initParams.getHandleSize    = TIDL_customMaxPool_ixX_oxX_getHandleSize;
 *   initParams.initFuncPtr      = TIDL_customMaxPool_ixX_oxX_init;
 *   initParams.execFuncPtr      = TIDL_customMaxPool_ixX_oxX_exec;
 *   initParams.kernelInitArgs   = & kernelInitArgs;
 *
 *   status = TIDL_DataflowInit(tidlHandle,
 *                              &initParams);
 *
 *   status = TIDL_DataflowProcess(tidlHandle,
 *                                 inPtrs,
 *                                 outPtrs);
 *
 *
 *   Usage Scenario 2 :
 *   User want to quick start with a basic implementation without separating initialization
 *   and core repetitive processing. Then they can avoid providing initFuncPtr and the same
 *   can be set it to NULL.
 *   In this scenario user is expected to adhere to the signature of execFuncPtr and the same can
 *   be found in TIDL_DataflowKernelExecFuncPtr located in this file. Mainly srcAddr and dstAddr
 *   should be used for implemenation. These two parameters can be ignored ( they will be NULL)
 *   if initFuncPtr != NULL
 *
 *    srcAddr and dstAddr uses a structure TIDL_bufParams3D_t which can be found inside
 *    ti_dl\tidl_bufParams.h. It has following fields :
 *    data_type
 *    dim_x : The width of the buffer in X dimension in elements. This corresponds to width
 *            of the tensor which is going to processed in a given kernel call
 *    dim_y : The Height of the buffer in Y dimension in elements. This corresponds to height
 *            of the tensor which is going to processed in a given kernel call
 *    dim_z : The depth of the buffer in Z dimension in elements. This corresponds to number of
 *            channels which are going to processed in a given kernel call
 *    stride_y : Jump in bytes to move in dimesntion Y
 *    stride_z : Jump in bytes to move in dimesntion Z
 *
 *
 *    Note :
 *    - Currently this API only supports layer which takes single input and generates single output.
 *    - Upscale kind of layers which increases the output resolution have not been validated
 *    - Ratio of input and output dimension is expected to be an integer.
 *    - Current implementation does not handle optimization for large resolution
