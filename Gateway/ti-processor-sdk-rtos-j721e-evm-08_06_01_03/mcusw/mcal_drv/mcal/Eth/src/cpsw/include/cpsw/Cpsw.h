/**
 *  \defgroup CPSW_API Gigabit Ethernet Switch (CPSW) low-level APIs
 *
 *  The Gigabit Ethernet Switch (CPSW) is present in the Jacinto 7 device
 *  family.  This CPSW driver implementation supports the MCU_CPSW0 instance
 *  which is part of the MCU domain and provides two ports: an Ethernet port
 *  (port 1) and an internal CPPI port (port 0 or host port).
 *
 *  The Ethernet port supports RMII and RGMII interfaces at 100 and 1000
 *  Mbps.  The CPSW also includes an Address Lookup Engine (ALE) and an
 *  Ethernet Statistics submodule.
