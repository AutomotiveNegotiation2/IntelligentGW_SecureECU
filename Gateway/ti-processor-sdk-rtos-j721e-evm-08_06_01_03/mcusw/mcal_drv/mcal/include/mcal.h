/**

 *  \mainpage  AUTOSAR MCAL Drivers for TI TDA4 SoCs
 *  The Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL) is the lowest software layer of the Basic Software.
 *  It contains internal drivers, which are software modules with direct access to the uC and internal peripherals
 *  - MCAL contains internal drivers, which are software modules with direct access
 *    to the uC and internal peripherals
 *  - MCAL makes higher software layers independent of uC
 *  - MCAL presents standardized and uC independent APIs to upper layers
 *
 * <b>
 * Also refer to MCAL driver user guide for detailed features,
 * limitations and usage description.
 * </b>
 *
 * The following MCAL drivers are implemented
 *
 *  - <b> CAN Driver </b> (See \ref MCAL_CAN_API) <br>
 *       The Can drivers provides services to control the CAN controller in a hardware
 *       independent API. The Can module provides services for initiating transmissions
 *       and calls the callback functions of the CanIf module for notifying events,
 *       independently from the hardware.Furthermore, it provides services to control
 *       the behavior and state of the CAN controllers that are belonging to the same CAN Hardware Unit
 *
 *  - <b> DIO Driver </b> (See \ref MCAL_DIO_API) <br>
 *       The DIO Driver provides services for reading and writing to/from
 *       -  DIO Channels (General Purpose IO Pins)
 *       -  DIO Ports    (General Purpose IO Registers)
 *       -  DIO Channel Groups (Portion of General Purpose IO Registers)
 *
 *  - <b> ETH Driver </b> (See \ref MCAL_ETH_API) <br>
 *        The main function of Ethernet Driver is to provide to the upper layer (Ethernet Interface)
 *        a hardware independent interface comprising multiple equal controllers.
 *        This interface is uniform for all controllers.
 *        Thus, the upper layer (Ethernet Interface) may access the underlying bus system in a uniform manner.
 *        The interface provides functionality for initialization, configuration and data transmission.
 *        The configuration of the Ethernet Driver however is bus specific, since it takes into account the
 *        specific features of the communication controller
 *
 *  - <b> ETH Transceiver Driver </b> (See \ref MCAL_ETHTRCV_API) <br>
 *        This provide the interface for the transceiver driver.
 *
 *  - <b> GPT Driver </b> (See \ref MCAL_GPT_API) <br>
 *        This provide the interface for the general purpose timer driver.
