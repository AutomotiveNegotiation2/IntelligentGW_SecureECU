/** \brief A Mailbox can raise multiple interrupts. In this implementation, the
 *          Mailbox new message interrupt is used determine presence of data
 *          from the remote core in the vring.
 *
 *          Typically, we would have 1 interrupt for each remote core. Due to
 *          system resource needs, multiple remote cores could use a single
 *          interrupt.
 *
 *          Depending on the SoC variant, the isr to registered with interrupt
 *          will change. Please refer CDD IPC example application to associate
 *          right ISR with interrupt.
