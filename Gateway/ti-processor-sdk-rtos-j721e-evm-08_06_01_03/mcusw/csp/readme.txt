MCAL CSP is organized in below structure:

1. Each driver has its own folder which includes reports associated to that particular driver. 
		a. This includes Evidence of Process Compliance, SW Detailed Design, SW bi-directional traceability report, SW Metrics Reports, Dynamic Analysis Reports, SW Test Reports. 
2. The "Common" folder will contain the documents which are common across all drivers.
		a. This includes SW Architecture Spec, SW Product Specification.  
3. The documents present in above folders will be SoC agnostic, and will give all information required for the drivers 
(HW IP). 
3. The "SoC Integration Package" will include SoC specific folders which will contain information for integrating MCAL for specific SoC.
		a. This includes SW Functional Safety Manual, SoC User Manual, SoC Test Reports.
