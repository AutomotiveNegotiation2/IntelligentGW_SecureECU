/**
 * \defgroup MCUSS_APP_CAN_PROFILE Can profiling application
 *
 *  This application perform CAN transmission on all the enabled instances.
 *  By default the CAN peripheral is configured to operate in loop-back mode,
 *  i.e. transmit and receive.
 *
 *  TI RTOS is used and CAN tx/rx is performed in a task, The CAN IF stub is
 *  is used to indicate completion of transmission / reception by posting a
 *  semaphore.
